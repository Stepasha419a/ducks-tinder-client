## Feature-Sliced Design

Frontend implements [Feature-Sliced Design](https://feature-sliced.design/) architectural methodology with some differences:

- `app` layer has more explicit slices like `store`, `styles` etc;
- `pages` layer is collection of standalone pages (f.e. page could have its own lib);
- `widgets` layer is collection of standalone widgets (f.e. widget could have its own lib);
- `features` layer also implement this division;
- `entities` layer is divided by 'main domain' folders;
- `shared` layer has more explicit slices like , `assets`, `api` etc;
